# Django Tutorial

This is just my implementation of the Django tutorial, which can be found [Here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/contents/)

## Installation

This is going to require installing a new virtual environment as well as installing Django in that environment. Easy peasy. I'm using an IDE and I always screw up the env creation command. One day I'll post it here.
